## Overview

Arena aggregates, normalizes, and ranks 34,000+ crypto traders across 35+ centralized and decentralized exchanges. Every trader receives an Arena Score, a composite metric combining ROI and absolute PnL on a 0-100 scale, allowing apples-to-apples comparison regardless of the originating platform. The system ingests data continuously through 53 scheduled cron jobs via 42 exchange connectors, enriches trader profiles with equity curves, position history, and advanced statistics, and serves the results through a Next.js 16 frontend with ISR and edge caching.

Beyond rankings, Arena provides a 60,000+ item educational library (books, research papers, whitepapers), real-time market data via TradingView WebSocket, community features (groups, posts, comments, reputation-gated access), trading competitions, on-chain attestation via EAS, and a Pro membership tier. The platform supports 4 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and runs on both web and native mobile (iOS/Android via Capacitor).

## Features

### Trader Rankings and Arena Score

Arena Score is a two-dimension composite metric scored on a 0-100 scale:

- **Return Score (0-60 points)**: Measures ROI using annualized log returns with a tanh sigmoid curve. Period-specific calibration coefficients ensure fair comparison across 7D, 30D, and 90D windows.
- **PnL Score (0-40 points)**: Measures absolute realized profit in USD, log-scaled to handle the wide range from small retail accounts to whale-tier PnL.

**Overall composite score**: `0.70 × S90D + 0.25 × S30D + 0.05 × S7D`, with a momentum bonus based on short-term vs medium-term performance.

Score confidence is tracked as `full`, `partial`, or `minimal` via a Wilson Score multiplier checking 5 signals (ROI, PnL, max drawdown, win rate, Sharpe ratio).

**V3 Percentile Scoring** (advanced): Three-dimension model — Profitability (35%), Risk Control (40%), Execution (25%) — using percentile rank within peer groups.

Rankings are available across three time windows: 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Unified Connector Framework.** All 42 exchange connectors extend `BaseConnector`, which provides HTTP with retry/backoff (via Cockatiel), rate limiting, circuit breaker (`ConsecutiveBreaker(5)` with 60s recovery), quality flags, and data provenance tracking. Each connector implements `discoverTraders()`, `fetchProfile()`, `fetchSnapshot()`, and `fetchTimeseries()`. The connector registry lazily initializes singletons per (platform, marketType).

**Three-Tier Proxy Strategy.** WAF-protected exchanges (Bybit, Bitget, BingX, MEXC, XT, Toobit) route through VPS Playwright scrapers first. Geo-blocked exchanges (Binance in some regions) use Cloudflare Worker proxy as fallback. OKX uses direct API (v5 public endpoints are not WAF-blocked). The proxy chain is transparent to connector code via `fetchViaVPS()`.

**Two-Table Snapshot Architecture.** `trader_snapshots_v2` is the sole write table for connector output. `leaderboard_ranks` is the precomputed read table for rankings, rebuilt every 30 minutes by `compute-leaderboard`. This separation keeps writes fast and reads indexed.

**Two-Phase Enrichment.** Data ingestion happens in two phases: (1) `batch-fetch-traders` discovers and upserts basic trader data (ROI, PnL, win rate) across all exchanges via 16 batch groups, (2) `batch-enrich` adds equity curves, position history, stats detail, and derived metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar) for top traders per platform across 26 enrichment modules.

**Incremental Static Regeneration.** Trader profile pages use ISR with `revalidate=300`. The leaderboard cache in Redis is refreshed by `warm-cache` every 5 minutes, so page loads hit warm cache rather than running expensive aggregate queries.

## Data Pipeline

The data pipeline consists of 53 Vercel cron jobs organized into several categories:

### Trader Data Ingestion

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tyche1107/ranking-arena.git
cd ranking-arena
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous key (client-side) |

| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | Upstash Redis REST endpoint |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Upstash Redis auth token |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Bearer token for cron job authentication |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe API secret key |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook signing secret |

Optional variables for monitoring and proxy:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_PROXY_URL` | CF Worker proxy URL |
| `VPS_PROXY_KEY` | API key for VPS proxy authentication |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry error tracking |
| `HEALTHCHECKS_PING_URL` | Healthchecks.io ping URL for dead man's switch |

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts at `http://localhost:3000` using Turbopack. The dev server requires `--max-old-space-size=3584` (already configured in the npm script).

### Build and Type Check

```bash
npm run build          # Production build
npm run type-check     # TypeScript strict mode check
npm run lint           # ESLint (no-console: error, no-explicit-any: warn)
npm run test           # Jest test suite (139 suites, 2,271 tests)
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright E2E tests
```

#### Troubleshooting: Jest reports `<rootDir>/jest.setup.js` not found

Jest 30 resolves modules via `unrs-resolver`, which loads a native binding at `node_modules/@unrs/resolver-binding-darwin-arm64/resolver.darwin-arm64.node` (or the equivalent for your platform). If that `.node` file is truncated/corrupt, `dlopen` fails and `jest-resolve`'s `findNodeModule` silently returns `null` for **every** path — including absolute, file-existing ones like `jest.setup.js`. The user-visible symptom is a misleading "Module not found" validation error.

Diagnose:

```bash
node -e "require('unrs-resolver')"   # surfaces the real dlopen error
```

Fix:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/@unrs/resolver-binding-darwin-arm64
npm install
```

A healthy `resolver.darwin-arm64.node` is ~1.7 MB. A truncated one (e.g. ~440 KB) is the corrupted file.

### Diagnostic Scripts

```bash
node scripts/pipeline-health-check.mjs          # Full pipeline health check
node scripts/pipeline-health-check.mjs --quick   # Quick data freshness check
node scripts/pipeline-health-check.mjs --fix     # Generate fix scripts
node scripts/diagnose-enrichment.mjs             # Enrichment API diagnostic
node scripts/check-data-distribution.mjs         # Data distribution analysis
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from the `main` branch.

```bash
vercel --prod          # Manual production deploy via Vercel CLI
git push origin main   # Triggers automatic deployment
```

All environment variables must be configured in the Vercel dashboard. The primary serverless function region is `hnd1` (Tokyo) to minimize latency to Asian exchange APIs and avoid geo-blocking.

### Cron Jobs

Cron schedules are defined in `vercel.json`. All 53 cron endpoints require an `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET` header. Schedules are staggered to avoid database connection contention (no two heavy jobs share the same minute offset).

### Infrastructure

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Vercel** | Edge + Serverless, region hnd1, 53 cron jobs |
| **SG VPS** (45.76.152.169) | Proxy :3456 + Playwright Scraper :3457 (PM2) |
| **JP VPS** (149.28.27.242) | Polymarket + exchange proxy |
| **Mac Mini** (OpenClaw) | Health monitor (30min), daily reports, auto-fix, weekly self-check |
| **Cloudflare Worker** | Geo-block bypass proxy with ALLOWED_HOSTS whitelist |

### Monitoring

- Pipeline health: `/api/health/pipeline` (used by OpenClaw Mac Mini monitor)
- Dependency health: `/api/health/dependencies` (checks Supabase, Redis, Stripe connectivity)
- Admin metrics: `/api/admin/metrics/trends` (pipeline success rates, error rates, active users)
- Healthchecks.io: dead man's switch on 5 critical cron jobs
- Sentry: client/server/edge error tracking
- Telegram alerts: automatic on cron job failures and data staleness
